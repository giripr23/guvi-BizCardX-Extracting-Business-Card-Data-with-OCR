BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

BizCardX is a Streamlit web application which extracts data from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Users can upload an image of a business card and the application extracts relevant information from the card. The extracted information is then displayed in a user-friendly format and can be stored in a MySQL database for future reference.

The application allows users to view, modify, or delete the extracted data. It also has a user interface for uploading business card images and a table interface for displaying the extracted data.
